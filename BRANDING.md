# **ZeroG: Brand & Style Guide**

## **1. The Manifesto**

**We don't type. We transmit.**

**ZeroG was born from the realization that typing is a bottleneck. It is a terrestrial limitation. We spent decades training our fingers to hit 100 Words Per Minute (WPM), only to realize that the speed of thought is infinite.**

**ZeroG is not just a dictation tool. It is an evolutionary step. Just as an astronaut in orbit unlearns the physics of gravity—expecting a pen to float rather than fall—ZeroG users unlearn the friction of the keyboard.**

**We are building the "Air Gap" for your thoughts: Private. Local. Weightless.**

## **2. The Hook & Tagline**

**To ensure clarity in search results while maintaining brand voice, we separate the Category Descriptor (what it is) from the Tagline (the emotional promise).**

**Category Descriptor (SEO Target):**

**"Open Source Voice Typing for macOS"**

**Primary Tagline:**

**"The voice typing tool so good, you'll forget how to type."**

**Secondary Taglines:**

* **"0 WPM. 100% Output."**  
* **"Vacuum sealed. No data leaves the ship."**  
* **"Don't let gravity hold back your thoughts."**

## **3. Brand Personality (Tone of Voice)**

**When writing copy, documentation, or release notes for ZeroG, the tone should be The Scrappy Pilot.**

* **Experimental, not Corporate: We are not a polished SaaS company. We are a piece of experimental hardware. We admit faults. We celebrate hacks.**  
* **Scientific & Space-Age: Use terminology from aerospace, physics, and computing.**  
  * ***Instead of "Settings," use "Flight Controls."***  
  * ***Instead of "Bugs," use "Turbulence" or "Drag."***  
  * ***Instead of "Privacy," use "Vacuum Sealed" or "Air Gapped."***  
* **The "Atrophy" Warning: We lean into the joke that using this tool will ruin your manual typing skills because it is superior. We treat the keyboard as a "legacy input device."**

## **4. Visual Identity**

**The visual language should feel like a Classified Flight Manual or a Terminal Window.**

### **Color Palette**

* **Void Black (`#0b0b0b`): The background. Deep space.**  
* **Terminal White (`#EDEDED`): Primary text. High contrast but not blinding.**  
* **Warning Yellow (`#FFD700`): Accents, alerts, and the cursor. The color of caution tape on a spaceship.**  
* **Vacuum Grey (`#333333`): Secondary elements and borders.**

### **Typography**

* **Primary Font: Monospace is mandatory for all headers and branding. (e.g., *JetBrains Mono*, *Space Mono*, or *Courier New*). This reinforces the tool's nature as code, not a word processor.**

### **Imagery**

* **The Floating Key: A single keyboard key lifting off a flat line, suspended in anti-gravity.**  
* **The Vacuum: Simple geometric circles or shields representing the local-only data privacy.**  
* **The Graph: A visual showing "Typing Effort" dropping to zero while "Output" remains high.**

## **5. Key Narratives**

**These are the pillars of the story we tell users.**

### **The "Vacuum Seal" (Privacy)**

**Most free tools pay for the server costs by selling user data. ZeroG is open-source and runs locally.**

* ***Narrative:*** **"In space, sound doesn't travel. In ZeroG, your voice doesn't travel either. It stays on your machine."**

### **The "Muscle Memory" Shift (UX)**

**We acknowledge that the shift to voice is jarring.**

* ***Narrative:*** **"Expect disorienting ease. You will reach for the keyboard, but the words will already be there. This is normal. Do not panic."**

## **6. AI Generation Prompt**

***Copy and paste the block below when asking an AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) to write code or copy for this project.***

**Role: You are acting as the Lead Engineer and Brand Guardian for "ZeroG," an open-source macOS voice typing tool.**

**Context: ZeroG is a scrappy, privacy-focused tool that uses local Whisper models. It is themed around space travel, zero-gravity physics, and the idea that keyboards are obsolete "terrestrial" anchors.**

**Terminology:**

* **Product Category: "Voice Typing" (Preferred over Dictation).**  
* **Key Benefit: Privacy ("Vacuum Sealed") and speed ("Zero Friction").**

**Style Requirements:**

1. **Tone: Scrappy, intelligent, slightly warning-focused (e.g., "Caution: May cause typing atrophy"). Use aerospace or physics metaphors where appropriate.**  
2. **Formatting: Use Markdown. Prefer monospace fonts for stylistic emphasis.**  
3. **Privacy: Always emphasize that data is "vacuum sealed" (local only).**  
4. **Bugs: If acknowledging errors, frame them as "orbital turbulence" or "calibration drift."**
